## Top Insights for Trading

### IV Crush - Quantitative Formula
**Implied Move = ATM Call Premium + ATM Put Premium**

Example: $100 stock, $5 straddle = 5% expected move

**Key Risk:** You can be directionally correct and still lose money if actual move < implied move

---

### Term Structure - Frequency Data
- **Contango:** >80% of time (normal state)
- **Backwardation:** <20% of time (stress state)

**Myth Busted:** Backwardation does NOT reliably predict market declines (CBOE analysis)

---

### Mean Reversion - Time Horizons
| Timeframe | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Intraday | Trending (NOT mean reverting) |
| Day-to-day | Mean reverting |
| 5+ years | Stays in 10-30 VIX range |

**Trading Tension:** Mean reversion (supports selling) vs. Volatility clustering (persistence risk)

## Critical Gaps

1. **IV Rank vs IV Percentile:** Schwab source inaccessible - NO calculation methodology extracted
2. **Statistical Evidence:** Mean reversion claims lack quantitative validation
3. **Trading Rules:** Concepts explained but no specific entry/exit thresholds

---

## Best Sources

1. **Option Alpha (IV Crush):** Comprehensive with examples - 17 facts
2. **CBOE (Backwardation):** Data-driven, myth-busting - 9 facts
3. **Macroption:** Useful frameworks but lacks depth
