# Phase 5.1 Plan 3: Frontend Nickname Support Summary

**TypeScript types and Vue components updated to support nickname field for credential identification**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-31T19:41:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-31T19:43:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Added nickname field to CredentialResponse and CredentialInput TypeScript interfaces
- Created getCredentialDisplayLabel helper function for consistent display logic
- Added nickname input field to AccountManagerDialog form
- Updated AccountSelector to show nickname when available, with fallback to type + date

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add Nickname to TypeScript Types** - `da21123` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add Nickname Input to AccountManagerDialog** - `16b79bc` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Update AccountSelector to Display Nicknames** - `b05d192` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `apps/orchestrator_3_stream/frontend/src/types/account.ts` - Added nickname fields and display helper
- `apps/orchestrator_3_stream/frontend/src/components/AccountManagerDialog.vue` - Added nickname form field
- `apps/orchestrator_3_stream/frontend/src/components/AccountSelector.vue` - Updated to display nicknames

## Decisions Made
- Use `nickname || credential_type || 'Unnamed Credential'` fallback chain in helper
- In AccountSelector, show fallback format (type + date) when nickname equals credential_type (avoids showing just "alpaca" which is not user-friendly)
- Nickname field is optional with placeholder "Paper Account 1" to guide users

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Frontend ready to display and accept nicknames
- Backend schema endpoint update needed (05.1-02) to complete the feature
- Existing credentials will show with default nickname (credential_type) until backend response includes nickname
