description: Create options skew-focused implementation plan using expertise context
argument-hint: [user_request]
---

# Purpose

You are operating a Higher Order Prompt (HOP) that creates implementation plans with options skew analysis expertise as the primary focus. It reads the expertise file and ensures the planning process is informed by deep domain knowledge of volatility skew patterns, strategy selection, and risk management.

## Variables

USER_REQUEST: $1
EXPERTISE_FILE: .claude/commands/experts/options-skew/expertise.yaml

## Instructions

- This is a simple two-step wrapper prompt that adds options skew expertise context to the planning process
- Keep the workflow concise: read expertise, then delegate to `/plan`
- The goal is to ensure options skew analysis elements of the request are prioritized
- Let the `/plan` command handle the actual planning logic while we provide domain context

## Workflow

1. **Load Options Skew Expertise Context**
   - Read EXPERTISE_FILE to understand skew patterns, decision logic, strategies, and risk management
   - Think of the expertise file as your **mental model** and memory reference for all options skew-related functionality
   - Identify critical sections: pattern_recognition, decision_logic, strategies, scoring_algorithm, risk_management
   - Focus on elements that relate to USER_REQUEST:
     - Data structures and required fields
     - Pattern classification algorithms
     - Strategy selection matrix
     - Confidence scoring algorithm
     - Liquidity requirements
     - Abort conditions and contraindications

2. **Execute Planning with Context**
   - Call `/plan` with USER_REQUEST as the argument
   - The planning will now be informed by the options skew expertise loaded in step 1
   - Prioritize options skew analysis elements in the implementation plan
   - Ensure any implementation respects:
     - The decision logic flow (validate → liquidity check → pattern → IV environment → contraindications)
     - Strategy selection based on skew pattern + IV Rank
     - Confidence scoring algorithm
     - Risk management rules

## Report

The report will be generated by the `/plan` command.
