## Frequently Asked Questions

How can I join Alpaca Elite?

Sign up for an account and deposit $30,000 today. Happy trading!


Do I need to apply to receive the perks?

No, with a $30,000 deposit, you are eligible to switch to the Elite Smart Router. With a $100,000 deposit, you will automatically receive a lower margin rate, free market data subscription, and white-glove account support.


What is Elite Smart Router?

It is an institutional-grade electronic trading strategy offering cost-effective solutions with higher API limits and premium order types. For example, Alpaca will try to access dark and non-displayed liquidity before crossing the spread on marketable orders.


Does qualifying for Alpaca Elite automatically switch me to Elite Smart Router?

No, Elite users can stay commission-free as long as the order flows
remain retail in nature. [See\
here](https://alpaca.markets/support/what-flags-an-account-as-non-retail-and-what-are-the-implications-of-being-flagged) for factors that could flag a user as non-retail.


How does pricing work for Elite Smart Router?


All-In Plan: $0.0040 per share, encompassing all potential fees and
rebates (not including regulatory fees)

Cost-Plus Plan: $0.0025 or lower per share with volume tiering as a
commission on top of your pass-through fees or rebates. Depending on your
order flows, you may receive rebates that can offset the Alpaca commission
to lower your overall trading cost.


Cost Plus example 1:


Buy 10 shares of XYZ @ market price


Order is executed on an exchange that charges a fee to take
liquidity of $0.0020 per share


User is charged 10 x $0.0020 = $0.020 for
exchange fees


User is charged 10 x $0.0020 = $0.020 of commission from
Alpaca


User is charged $0.040


Cost Plus example 2:


Buy 10 shares of XYZ limit
price of $10


Limit price is not marketable and therefore the limit order
rests in the orderbook of an exchange


Order is eventually executed at the
limit price and exchange pays a rebate of $0.0018 per share


User receives
10 x $0.0018 = $0.018 rebate from exchange


User is charged 10 x $0.0020 =
$0.020 of commission from Alpaca


User is charged $0.002


Notes:


- The examples
above are only indicative and will depend on where the orders are
actually
executed. Alpaca utilizes an institutional grade smart order router
that has access to a variety of exchanges, ATS and dark pools.

- The examples above do not consider REG and TAF fees
