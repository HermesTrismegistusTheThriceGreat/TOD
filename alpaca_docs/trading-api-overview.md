# Alpaca Trading API Overview

## Paper Trading

Paper trading is free and available to all Alpaca users. Paper trading is a real-time simulation environment where you can test your code. You can reset and test your algorithm as much as you want using free, real-time market data.

For more information, visit the [Paper Trading documentation](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/paper-trading).

## Account Plans

Anyone globally can create a paper only account. All you need to do is sign up with your email address. Alpaca also offers live brokerage accounts (with real money) for individuals and businesses plus crypto accounts.

## Crypto Trading

Alpaca offers crypto trading through our API and the Alpaca web dashboard! Trade all day, seven days a week, as frequently as you'd like.

## Understand Orders

Our Trading API supports different order types such as market, limit and stop orders plus more complex ones.

For more information, visit the [Orders at Alpaca documentation](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/orders-at-alpaca).

## Fractional Trading

Fractional shares are fractions of a whole share, meaning that you don't need to buy a whole share to own a portion of a company. You can now buy as little as $1 worth of shares for over 2,000 US equities.

For more information, visit the [Fractional Trading documentation](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/fractional-trading).

**Note:** We only allow market orders for fractional trading at the moment.

## User Protections

We have enabled several types of protections to enhance your trading experience.
