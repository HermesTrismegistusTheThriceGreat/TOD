  user_input_on_enter: /question please use haiku scouters, review the codebase, I'm
    thinking to deploy part of our application but not the whole thing. I would like
    to deploy the Positions Page and Calendar page only from the Orchestrator, I don't
    want to deploy the Orchestrator features such as the O-Agent Swim lane, and the
    Agents swimlanes. I want to keep the agent functionality, so I can slowly bring
    in new buttons to the deployment to access different custom agents. Is there a
    simple way to do this? Planning ot use Nellify MCP Server
