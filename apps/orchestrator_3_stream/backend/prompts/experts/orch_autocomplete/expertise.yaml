  user_input_on_enter: "Been working with  theta-collector to get the output correct,\
    \ the feed back from a review of their output on GLD yesterday is below in parentheses,\
    \ spawn an Opus /planner to review the recommended fix, and make a plan to fix\
    \ the issue, then spawn an Opus /fix agent to implement the recommendations. :\
    \ (The Formulas Are Correct\n\n  I verified each formula mathematically - they're\
    \ all sound for iron butterfly calculations.\n\n  But There's a Critical Issue\n\
    \n  Let me reverse-engineer the agent's numbers:\n\n  Jan 28 / 6pt wings:\n  -\
    \ Net Credit = $5.65, Max Loss = $0.35, \u03B8/Risk = 15.26%\n  - Implied Net\
    \ Theta = 0.1526 \xD7 0.35 = $0.0534/day\n\n  Jan 23 / 6pt wings:\n  - Net Credit\
    \ = $5.27, Max Loss = $0.73, \u03B8/Risk = 14.29%\n  - Implied Net Theta = 0.1429\
    \ \xD7 0.73 = $0.1043/day\n\n  Here's the problem: Jan 23 has HIGHER net theta\
    \ ($0.1043) than Jan 28 ($0.0534), which is correct since it's closer to expiration.\
    \ But Jan 28 ranks #1 for \u03B8/Risk because its Max Loss ($0.35) is so small.\n\
    \n  The \u03B8/Risk metric is distorted by tiny Max Loss values.\n\n  When Max\
    \ Loss approaches zero, \u03B8/Risk explodes toward infinity - even with modest\
    \ theta. This is mathematically valid but practically misleading.\n\n  The Real\
    \ Issue: 113% Credit Claim\n\n  Jan 30 / 6pt wings with 113% Credit:\n    Net\
    \ Credit = 6 \xD7 1.13 = $6.78\n    Max Loss = 6 - 6.78 = -$0.78\n\n  This claims\
    \ a risk-free $0.78 profit regardless of outcome.\n\n  This doesn't exist in real\
    \ markets. The agent flagged it correctly, but the fact it calculated this at\
    \ all indicates the input data was bad - likely:\n  - Stale/asynchronous quotes\n\
    \  - INDICATIVE feed (model-based, not live)\n  - Wide bid-ask spreads that aren't\
    \ crossable\n\n  Suggested Fix\n\n  Add to the agent's calculation step:\n\n \
    \ # After calculating Max Loss\n  if max_loss <= 0.10:  # Less than $0.10 max\
    \ loss is suspicious\n      flag = \"\u26A0\uFE0F VERIFY QUOTES - Max loss near\
    \ zero suggests data issue\"\n\n  if credit_pct > 95:  # Credit approaching wing\
    \ width\n      flag = \"\u26A0\uFE0F CHECK FILL QUALITY - Credit/Width ratio unusually\
    \ high\"\n\n  # Consider alternative metric that doesn't explode with small denominators\n\
    \  theta_per_dollar_credit = net_theta / net_credit  # More stable\n\n  The current\
    \ \u03B8/Risk formula (Net Theta / Max Loss) \xD7 100 creates a division by small\
    \ number problem that amplifies data errors into spectacular-looking results.)"
